--Description
This application will allow you to produce barcodes either individually, or based on a script file.

It supports QRCode, EAN 9 and EAN 13.

I use this application to easily produce the QRCodes that link my Android applications to the Android Market.

It is released under GPL and was developed in C# 2008.

Uses the QRCode library found here: http://www.twit88.com/platform/projects/show/mt-qrcode and is based on the C# example of the toolkit.
